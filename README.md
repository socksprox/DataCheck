# DataCheck - 50+mobiel App Replacement

A beautiful, native iOS client for checking your 50+mobiel data consumption. This app is built with Swift and offers a modern and user-friendly alternative to the official 50+mobiel app.

This project was created with assistance from Cascade, an AI coding assistant.

## Key Features

- **All Your Info in One View:** See your remaining data, SMS, and voice call minutes at a glance on a single dashboard.
- **Data Consumption Tracking:** Clear progress bars show you exactly how much of your monthly allowance you've used.
- **Home Screen Widget:** Keep an eye on your data usage without even opening the app, a feature not available in the official app.
- **Fully Native Experience:** Enjoy a fast, responsive, and seamless experience built entirely in Swift for iOS.
- **Secure Login:** Securely log in to your 50+mobiel account with a two-step authentication process.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, card-based interface that's easy to navigate.
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Easily update your usage data by pulling down on the main screen.
